My website is development using HTML, CSS, pure JavaScript, Ajax and PHP (Procedural and OOP) and you are willing to modify all or any of these files. All I ask is you give me credit in one of the files.

There's no need for a php framework or a javascript library. All that is needed is a web server with PHP 7 and MySQL and composer for the autoloader. Some knowledge of PHP will be required to get this to work properly, for I haven't written an installer and probably won't, for this is just a small project of mine and I want it to stay that way. It would also be useful to have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
