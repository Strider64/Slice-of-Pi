# Slice-of-Technology
My website in development using HTML, CSS and PHP


I'm in the process of turning my website in to a fully capable Content Management System (CMS) and so far so good. I plan on changing it slight so it uses a pattern so that it will be real easy to setup on any website. Not all the files are updated or uploaded to Slice of Technology repository. However, in the next couple of weeks I hope to have most of them uploaded. While I have been testing this out on my local server and remote server just just remember I'm not responsible if any thing goes wrong. However, I pretty postive it won't, but anyone notices a glaring please send me an email my way. Thanks John
